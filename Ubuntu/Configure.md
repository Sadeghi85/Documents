- disable `root` account
```
$ useradd -m -s $(which bash) -G sudo poweruser
$ passwd poweruser
```
```
$ visudo

[...]
	#%sudo  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
	%sudo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

	Defaults:%sudo    !requiretty
[...]
```
```
$ usermod --lock root
```
> now logout and login as the newly created admin account

> description
>
> the newly created admin account is effectively like the root; It can sudo, doesn't need to enter password for sudo and doesn't require tty to login(so you can login as root with WinSCP even though the root account is disabled; under WinSCP advanced option SCP/Shell, choose `sudo su -` as shell), therefore all security concerns about root applies to this account too, except now the attacker needs to also guess the username instead of just brute-forcing root's password.

- enable `root` account
> login with an account with sudo permission

$ passwd
